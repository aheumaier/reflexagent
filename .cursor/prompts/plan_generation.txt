I need to implement: initialize project structure and DI wiring..
- Add directories app/core/domain, app/core/use_cases, app/ports, app/adapters.
- Wire up your dependency_injection.rb initializer with empty placeholders for each port.
- Commit: chore: initialize project structure and DI wiring.

1. Propose a 5â€“7 step implementation plan.  
2. Each step should be independent and commit-sized.  
3. Reference existing modules under `app/core` or `app/adapters`.  
4. Ask clarifying questions if needed.

# Technical Debt Review: ReflexAgent

## Code Smells & Anti-Patterns

### High Severity

- **God Class: ReflexiveAgent**
  - Location: `app/core/domain/reflexive_agent.rb`
  - Issue: This class is 288 lines long with many responsibilities, including managing sensors, actuators, rules, and handling both legacy and new interfaces
  - Impact: Difficult to maintain, test, and extend
  - Recommendation: Split into smaller collaborating classes (e.g., RuleEngine, SensorManager, ActuatorManager)

- **Bloated Use Case: CalculateMetrics**
  - Location: `app/core/use_cases/calculate_metrics.rb`
  - Issue: 323 lines with multiple responsibilities (event classification, repository management, metric calculation)
  - Impact: Violates Single Responsibility Principle, making maintenance difficult
  - Recommendation: Extract repository-specific logic to separate classes, use composition

- **Mixed Abstraction Levels in EventRepository**
  - Location: `app/adapters/repositories/event_repository.rb`
  - Issue: Mixes low-level database operations with business logic transformations
  - Impact: Complicates testing and violates adapter pattern principles
  - Recommendation: Extract transformation logic to separate mapper class

### Medium Severity

- **Duplication in Domain Model Validation**
  - Location: Multiple domain models (Sensor, Actuator, ReflexiveAgent)
  - Issue: Similar validation logic repeated in each model
  - Impact: Potential consistency issues as validation rules evolve
  - Recommendation: Extract to shared validation module or validator objects

- **Complex Conditionals in EventRepository**
  - Location: `app/adapters/repositories/event_repository.rb:58-94`
  - Issue: Nested conditionals for finding events by different IDs
  - Impact: Difficult to follow logic flow and challenging to test
  - Recommendation: Extract to strategy pattern or query objects

### Low Severity

- **Long Parameter Lists in UseCases**
  - Location: Multiple use case classes
  - Issue: Many dependencies passed through constructors
  - Impact: Difficult to initialize and test
  - Recommendation: Consider parameter objects or builder pattern

## Architecture Drift

### High Severity

- **Direct Rails Framework Dependencies in Domain Code**
  - Location: `app/core/use_cases/calculate_metrics.rb:24-36`
  - Issue: Direct calls to Rails.logger in core business logic
  - Impact: Violates hexagonal architecture's dependency rule
  - Recommendation: Use injected logger_port instead of Rails.logger

- **ActiveRecord Dependency Leaks**
  - Location: `app/core/use_cases/calculate_metrics.rb:74-104`
  - Issue: Direct references to ActiveRecord::Base.transaction and implicit dependencies on Rails ORM
  - Impact: Core domain code is tightly coupled to framework
  - Recommendation: Move transaction logic to repository adapter

### Medium Severity

- **Inconsistent Port Usage**
  - Location: `app/core/use_cases/process_event.rb`
  - Issue: Some use cases use ports directly, others use repositories
  - Impact: Inconsistent architecture makes the system harder to understand
  - Recommendation: Standardize on port usage throughout use cases

- **Missing Adapter Implementations**
  - Location: Several ports lack corresponding adapters
  - Issue: Architecture promises ports/adapters but implementation is incomplete
  - Impact: Makes it harder to replace components or test in isolation
  - Recommendation: Implement missing adapters or remove unused ports

## Performance Concerns

### High Severity

- **N+1 Query Pattern in Event Processing**
  - Location: `app/core/use_cases/calculate_metrics.rb:76-98`
  - Issue: Each repository registration creates multiple database queries
  - Impact: Performance degradation as event volume increases
  - Recommendation: Batch repository registrations, use eager loading

- **Memory Leaks in EventRepository Cache**
  - Location: `app/adapters/repositories/event_repository.rb:10-12`
  - Issue: Unbounded in-memory cache with no eviction strategy
  - Impact: Potential OOM errors as application runs
  - Recommendation: Add LRU caching or delegate to proper cache adapter

### Medium Severity

- **Inefficient Metric Classification**
  - Location: `app/core/domain/metric_classifier.rb`
  - Issue: Linear scanning of event data for each classification
  - Impact: Poor performance for complex events or high volumes
  - Recommendation: Optimize with indexed lookups or pattern matching

- **Missing Database Indexes**
  - Location: Various database models
  - Issue: Missing indexes on frequently queried fields (event_type, aggregate_id)
  - Impact: Slow database operations as scale increases
  - Recommendation: Add appropriate indexes based on query patterns

## Test Coverage Gaps

### High Severity

- **Limited Integration Tests for Use Cases**
  - Location: `spec/integration/use_cases/` (only 2 files)
  - Issue: Most use cases lack integration tests with real adapters
  - Impact: Changes could break actual runtime behavior
  - Recommendation: Add integration tests for all primary use cases

- **Missing Performance Tests**
  - Location: No performance or load tests found
  - Issue: No validation of system behavior under load
  - Impact: Unknown scaling limits and bottlenecks
  - Recommendation: Add performance tests for critical flows (event processing)

### Medium Severity

- **Mocked Tests for ReflexiveAgent**
  - Location: `spec/unit/core/domain/reflexive_agent_spec.rb:1-20`
  - Issue: Tests use mocked sensor/actuator instead of actual implementations
  - Impact: May miss integration issues between real components
  - Recommendation: Add integration tests with real Sensor/Actuator implementations

- **Incomplete Test Coverage for Adapters**
  - Location: Limited tests for repositories and other adapters
  - Issue: Adapter implementations not fully tested
  - Impact: Higher risk of runtime errors when interacting with external systems
  - Recommendation: Add comprehensive tests for all adapters

## Documentation Shortcomings

### High Severity

- **Missing ADRs for Key Components**
  - Location: `docs/architecture/` lacks ADRs for several systems
  - Issue: Design decisions for metrics, events, agents not documented
  - Impact: New developers lack context for design decisions
  - Recommendation: Document key architectural decisions in ADR format

- **Outdated Architecture Documentation**
  - Location: `docs/architecture/README.md` doesn't reflect current implementation
  - Issue: Documentation describes ideal architecture not actual implementation
  - Impact: Difficult for developers to understand actual system structure
  - Recommendation: Update documentation to match current code reality

### Medium Severity

- **Inconsistent Code Comments**
  - Location: Throughout the codebase
  - Issue: Some classes have extensive comments, others minimal or none
  - Impact: Uneven understanding of code purpose and behavior
  - Recommendation: Establish and enforce comment standards across codebase

- **Missing Deployment Documentation**
  - Location: No clear deployment or scaling documentation
  - Issue: Operations procedures not documented
  - Impact: Difficult to deploy or scale the application
  - Recommendation: Add operations and deployment guides

### Low Severity

- **Insufficient API Documentation**
  - Location: Controllers and API endpoints lack documentation
  - Issue: External interface contract not clearly specified
  - Impact: Difficult for API consumers to integrate
  - Recommendation: Add API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger

# ADR-0001: Use Hexagonal Architecture

**Status**: accepted  
**Date**: 2025-04-30

## Context

We need a clean separation between our core business logic and the external infrastructure (Rails, Redis, Slack, Sidekiq, etc.) to:

- Enable high testability of domain logic without relying on external systems.
- Allow future swapping or upgrading of infrastructure components with minimal changes to business code.
- Enforce a clear boundary between pure Ruby domain use cases and framework-specific code.

## Decision

Adopt the **Ports & Adapters (Hexagonal) architecture**, structured as follows:

- **Core (Domain & Use Cases)**: All business logic lives under `app/core/`, implemented as plain Ruby objects.
- **Ports**: Define interfaces in `app/ports/`:
  - IngestionPort (e.g., receive_event)
  - StoragePort (save_event, save_metric, save_alert, fetch_threshold)
  - CachePort (read, write)
  - NotificationPort (send)
  - QueuePort (enqueue)
  - DashboardPort (fetch_metrics, fetch_alerts)
- **Adapters**: Implement each port in `app/adapters/`:
  - Web (Rails Controllers) → IngestionPort
  - Repositories (ActiveRecord models) → StoragePort
  - Redis client → CachePort
  - Slack Notifier → NotificationPort
  - Sidekiq Worker → QueuePort
  - UI (Hotwire/Stimulus) → DashboardPort
- **Dependency Injection**: Wire ports to adapters in `config/initializers/dependency_injection.rb`.

This design ensures the core remains unaware of Rails or other frameworks.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- **Testability**: Core use cases and domain models can be tested in isolation using port mocks.
- **Replaceability**: Swapping out Redis for another cache or Slack for email notifications requires changes only in the corresponding adapter.
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns reduces coupling and makes the codebase easier to reason about and evolve.

**Negative:**

- **Initial Boilerplate**: Setting up ports, adapters, and DI wiring introduces upfront work compared to a standard Rails MVC approach.
- **Learning Curve**: Developers must understand and follow the hexagonal pattern to keep layers properly separated.

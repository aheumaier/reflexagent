# ADR-0004: Refactoring the MetricClassifier with Dependency Injection

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The MetricClassifier has grown to nearly 800 lines with multiple responsibilities:
- Classify events from different sources (GitHub, Jira, etc.)
- Extract dimensions from events
- Create metric definitions

This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the code difficult to maintain.

## Decision
We will refactor the MetricClassifier into multiple classes:
1. A main MetricClassifier that delegates to source-specific classifiers
2. Individual classifiers for each event source
3. A DimensionExtractor for extracting dimensions from events

We will use dependency injection to wire these components together.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Better testability of individual components
- Easier to extend with new event sources
- More aligned with SOLID principles

### Negative
- Slightly increased complexity in the overall architecture
- Need to ensure performance doesn't degrade with multiple object allocations

## Performance Considerations
With expected throughput of 10 events/second:
- Keep object instantiation lightweight
- Consider memoization strategies
- Ensure classifiers work well with batch processing

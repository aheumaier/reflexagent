# ADR-0004: Refactoring the MetricClassifier with Dependency Injection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The MetricClassifier has grown to nearly 800 lines with multiple responsibilities:
- Classify events from different sources (GitHub, Jira, etc.)
- Extract dimensions from events
- Create metric definitions

This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the code difficult to maintain.

## Decision
We will refactor the MetricClassifier into multiple classes:
1. A main MetricClassifier that delegates to source-specific classifiers
2. Individual classifiers for each event source
3. A DimensionExtractor for extracting dimensions from events

We will use dependency injection to wire these components together.

## Implementation
The refactoring has been completed with the following changes:

1. The original MetricClassifier now delegates to source-specific classifiers:
   - `Domain::Classifiers::GithubEventClassifier`
   - `Domain::Classifiers::JiraEventClassifier`
   - `Domain::Classifiers::BitbucketEventClassifier`
   
2. The MetricClassifier provides fallback implementations when specific classifiers are not provided, ensuring backward compatibility.

3. A `Domain::Extractors::DimensionExtractor` class has been created to handle dimension extraction logic.

4. Dependency injection has been updated to wire these components together in the system.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Better testability of individual components
- Easier to extend with new event sources
- More aligned with SOLID principles

### Negative
- Slightly increased complexity in the overall architecture
- Need to ensure performance doesn't degrade with multiple object allocations

## Performance Considerations
With expected throughput of 10 events/second:
- Keep object instantiation lightweight
- Consider memoization strategies
- Ensure classifiers work well with batch processing

## Future Work
- Complete migration of all classifier logic to dedicated classifier classes
- Remove fallback implementations once all dependencies are properly injected
- Extend with additional source-specific classifiers for other event sources

# ADR-0002: Rails as Host Platform vs API-Only + React/shadcn UI

**Status**: accepted  
**Date**: 2025-04-30

## Context

For the ReflexAgent POC, we must deliver a working prototype within one month, featuring live-updating dashboards, Slack nudges, and responsive interfaces. However, we anticipate that future phases may require richer, component-based front-end functionality (e.g., complex charts, drag-and-drop, interactive visualizations) that could benefit from a modern JavaScript framework.

## Decision

Use **Rails Views + Hotwire** for Phase 1 and plan for a migration to **API-Only Rails + React with shadcn/ui** in Phase 2:

- **Phase 1 (Fast POC Delivery)**
  - Implement UI as server-rendered Rails views using ERB, TailwindCSS, and Hotwire (Turbo & Stimulus) for live updates and minimal JavaScript.
  - Benefit: Leverage Rails generators and conventions to build forms, tables, and simple dashboards with negligible setup overhead.

- **Phase 2 (Enhanced Front-End Features)**
  - Extract a JSON/GraphQL API under `/api/v1/…` with Rails in API-only mode.
  - Introduce React components with shadcn/ui in `app/javascript` for high-interactivity (e.g., complex dashboard widgets).
  - Migrate existing views incrementally or via a greenfield front-end app.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- **Rapid Initial Delivery**: Phase 1 can be completed in days, meeting the one-month POC target.
- **Minimal Tech Overhead**: No need to configure React, Node tooling, or CORS for the initial prototype.
- **Clear Upgrade Path**: Future enhancement to React/shadcn UI is pre-planned, reducing rework risk.

**Negative:**

- **Temporary Duplication**: Some initial view code may be superseded or remain unused after migration.
- **Context-Switch**: Phase 2 introduces a new front-end technology stack, requiring developer ramp-up.
- **Additional Complexity**: Maintaining both server-rendered and client-rendered layers during transition.

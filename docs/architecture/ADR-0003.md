## Context

As we integrate more advanced ML and AI-driven features (e.g., anomaly detection, similarity-based what-if queries), we need a robust, high-performance store for vector embeddings. Requirements include:

- **Similarity Search**: Efficient k-NN queries over high-dimensional embeddings.
- **Scalability**: Handle growing volumes of embeddings as data accumulates.
- **Integration**: Seamless support for Python-based ML workflows and potential Rails access.
- **Operational Simplicity**: Managed or self-hosted deployment with minimal overhead.

## Decision

Adopt **Chroma** as our dedicated vector database for storing and querying embeddings:

- **Service**: Run Chroma as a standalone Python microservice (FastAPI) or container.
- **Port Definition**: Add an `EmbeddingsPort` in `app/ports/` with methods:
  - `persist_embeddings(id, vectors)`
  - `query_similar(vectors, top_k)`
  - `delete_embeddings(ids)`
- **Adapter Implementation**:
  - Python adapter (`adapters/embeddings/chroma_client.py`) wraps Chroma SDK or HTTP API.
  - Rails adapter (`adapters/embeddings/chroma_adapter.rb`) invokes the microservice via HTTP/gRPC.
- **Deployment**: Include Chroma service in `render.yaml` (or Helm chart) alongside Rails and ML services.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- + **Fast Similarity Queries**: k-NN searches complete in milliseconds.  
- + **ML Ecosystem Alignment**: Chroma integrates easily with Python libraries and Jupyter workflows.  
- + **Future-Proof**: Easily swap to other vector DBs (e.g., Pinecone) by replacing the adapter.

**Negative:**

- – **Additional Infrastructure**: Introduces a new service to deploy, monitor, and scale.  
- – **Operational Overhead**: Requires managing data persistence, backfills, and migrations for embeddings.  
- – **Cross-Language Complexity**: Rails-to-Python calls add latency and more complex error handling.

**Mitigations:**

- Automate Chroma deployment with Docker and health checks.  
- Cache frequent queries in Redis via `CachePort` to reduce redundant vector searches.  
- Implement retries and circuit breakers in the Rails adapter.
